# melthoriseonmock

Challenge 1

-For challenge 1, I was tasked to refactor the css code to clean and simplify. I have added comments to the style.css file. The screenshot below includes the deployed look of the application. You will also find the user story.

-The site deployed is a informational site for Horiseon.

"AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines"
